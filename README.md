# truncatedSVD

This repository holds the relevant documents and code for reproducing the Truncated SVD algorithm outlined by Vassilis Kalantzis, Georgios Kollias, Shashanka Ubaru, Athanasios N. Nikolakopoulos, Lior Horesh, and Kenneth L. Clarkson in their paper ``Projection techniques to update the truncated SVD of evolving matrices'' published in the 2021 Thirty-eighth International Conference on Machine Learning.
We (Andy Chen, Shion Matsumoto, and Rohan Sinha Varma) present this repository as an entry into the 2021 Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge.
